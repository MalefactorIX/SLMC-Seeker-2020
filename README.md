# SLMC-Seeker-2020
Original Concept by Sin Straaf. This Git merely puts his idea into action.

The purpose of this git is to provide examples of the ways to implement improved behaviour for tracking munitions and launchers in order to make them compliant with regions that may be looking at supporting them.
